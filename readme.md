## YouTube AdBlock Blocker Blocker

Silly little Chrome extension to bypass YouTube's "Ad blockers are not allowed on YouTube" blurb by replacing the disabled video player with an iframe embedded player.  
Probably not the best way to do this, but it works.

Working as of 10 Jan 2023, with Chrome Version `120.0.6099.200 (Official Build) (64-bit)`

### Installation

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
2. Make sure the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right is enabled
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the "[YTABBB](./YTABBB)" directory

A more detailed process with images can be found in the Chrome Developers [Hello World extension guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).
